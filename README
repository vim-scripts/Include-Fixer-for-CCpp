Include Fixer organizes C and C++ #include header files to be in specific
categories, as well as organizing alphabetically. Default categories are
provided, as well as the option to customize categories

Usage:
Once installed, use the following command to organize include files:
    :FixIncludes

The command will search for lines containing #include directives, and organize
them into different categories and alphabetically within those categories.
Note: this includes whether the include is written as "file.h" or <file.h>.
All includes starting with " will precede those starting with <

The plugin comes with a number of default categories. Each category is
separated from the others with a blank line. The default categories are
arranged in the following order:
        module
        local
        boost
        qt
        c std library
        c++ std library
